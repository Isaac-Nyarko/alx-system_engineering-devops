Issue Summary:

Duration: May 30, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete service outage during the incident. Users were unable to access the application and encountered error messages. Approximately 75% of the users were affected.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden spike in error rates and a drop in server response times.
Actions taken: The incident response team immediately started investigating the issue, focusing on the web server and database components. Assumptions were made that the issue could be related to database connectivity or a misconfiguration in the web server.
Misleading investigation: Initially, the team focused on troubleshooting the database server, assuming it was the root cause of the issue. Extensive testing and debugging were performed on the database connections and configurations.
10:30 AM: As the investigation continued, it was realized that the issue was not related to the database, leading to a redirection of efforts towards the web server and load balancer.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team and the development team to gather expertise and insights into the web server stack.
11:00 AM: The team identified an issue with the load balancer configuration, suspecting it to be the root cause of the outage.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was updated to rectify the misconfiguration, and the web server stack was restarted.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration of the load balancer resulted in incorrect routing of traffic, causing a disruption in the web server's ability to handle requests.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure proper traffic distribution, and the web server stack was restarted to implement the changes.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring to promptly detect load balancer configuration issues.
Enhance the incident response process by involving all relevant teams from the beginning to ensure a quicker and more accurate diagnosis.
Conduct regular load balancer configuration audits to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch the load balancer software to the latest version.
Review and update the load balancer configuration to adhere to best practices.
Enhance monitoring by implementing alerts for load balancer health and configuration changes.
This postmortem provides an overview of a web stack outage incident that occurred on May 30, 2023. The incident was promptly detected, investigated, and resolved by identifying a misconfiguration in the load balancer. Corrective measures were suggested to prevent similar incidents in the future, including implementing automated monitoring and conducting regular audits of load balancer configurations. Tasks were outlined to address the immediate issue, such as patching the load balancer software and updating the configuration.
