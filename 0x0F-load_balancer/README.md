<h1>Load balancer</h1>
Ever wonder how Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and other web giants are handling such huge amounts of traffic? They donâ€™t have just one server, but tens of thousands of them. 
In order to achieve this, web traffic needs to be distributed to these servers, and that is the role of a load-balancer.
